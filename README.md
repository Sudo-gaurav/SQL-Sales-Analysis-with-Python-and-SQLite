# SQL Sales Analysis using Python & SQLite

This project demonstrates how to perform simple **sales data analysis** using **SQL queries inside Python** with **SQLite** as the backend. The goal is to compute sales metrics such as total units sold and total revenue per product and visualize the results using basic plots.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- 🧾 Dataset: A sample in-memory sales dataset created manually in Python
- 💾 Database: SQLite (embedded, no setup needed)
- 📌 Key Metrics Analyzed:
  - Total units sold per product
  - Total revenue per product
  - Average price per product

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.9**
- **SQLite3**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

---

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

- Creating an SQLite database and table using Python
- Inserting sales records manually into the database
- Running SQL queries directly from Python using `pandas.read_sql_query()`
- Analyzing and summarizing sales metrics
- Creating basic visualizations (bar charts) using Matplotlib

---

## 📈 Output Visualizations

Although the charts are generated within the notebook, they include:
- Bar chart showing revenue per product
- Additional charts showing quantity and average price can be added if needed

---

## 🗂️ Files Included

- `Python Script.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all steps, queries, and visualizations
- `Python Script.pdf` – PDF version of the notebook

---
